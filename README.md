# Exploratory Data Analysis 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the most important components to any data science experiment. It's "a first look" at our dataset and is used to understand and summarize the content of our dataset by selecting the features in which we later feed into our machine learning algorithms. 

EDA generally is classified into two methods, non-graphical and graphical. Each method can be applied to one variable/column (univariate) or a combination of variables/columns (bivariate).

It is also good practice to understand the problem statement and dataset prior to diving neck deep into EDA.

# Dataset 
- train.csv - the training set
- test.csv - the test set
- data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
- sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ekami66/detailed-data-exploration-in-python/data)

# Highlights 
- Numerical Data Distribution 
- Feature correlation 
- Feature to feature relationship
- Quantitative to qualitative relationship
- Categorical to Quantitative relationship
